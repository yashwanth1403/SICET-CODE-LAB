// Troubleshooting script for Next button issues
console.log("Starting troubleshooting for Next button issues...");

// Common issues to check:
console.log("\n1. Open your browser console (F12) to see error logs");
console.log("   Look for validation errors after clicking Next");

console.log("\n2. Make sure all test cases have input and output filled:");
console.log("   - Check if all visible test cases have input and output");
console.log("   - Check if all hidden test cases have input and output");

console.log("\n3. Other common issues that prevent Next from working:");
console.log("   - Make sure all coding problems have titles");
console.log(
  "   - Make sure all multiple choice questions have at least one correct answer"
);
console.log(
  "   - Check that languages for coding problems have all required fields"
);

console.log("\n4. Steps to verify test case requirements:");
console.log(
  "   - Each coding problem must have exactly 3 visible and 2 hidden test cases"
);
console.log(
  "   - Verify this by counting the checkboxes for 'Hidden Test Case'"
);
console.log("   - If you have more than 5 test cases, remove extras");
console.log(
  "   - If you have fewer than 5, add more until you meet requirements"
);

console.log("\nINSTRUCTIONS:");
console.log(
  "1. Make sure you have exactly 5 test cases for each coding problem"
);
console.log(
  "2. Ensure 3 are visible (unchecked 'Hidden' box) and 2 are hidden (checked 'Hidden' box)"
);
console.log("3. Fill in ALL test cases with input and output text");
console.log("4. Try clicking Next again");

console.log(
  "\nIf you're still having issues, refresh the page and try again with a new problem."
);
